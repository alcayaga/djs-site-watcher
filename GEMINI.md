# Project: Discord Site Watcher

## General Instructions

- Ensure all new functions and classes have JSDoc comments.
- Document the code using clear and concise comments. Focus on explaining the reasoning (why) behind the code, not just describing what the code does.
- This is legacy code, propose architectural changes when applicable.
- Write tests when adding new functionality, ensure they are robust and test the actual production logic.
- Do not commit any temporary or user-specific test data, URLs, or configurations into the production.


## Commit Workflow
- Approval First: After staging files, you MUST provide the full, final git commit message for my review and wait for my explicit "ok" or "approved" before executing the commit. Do not proceed with a commit just because a plan was approved.
- Atomic Commits: Keep commits small and focused. Each commit should represent a single logical change (e.g., one feature, one bug fix, one refactor). Do not group unrelated changes into a single commit.
- When writing the commit message, don't use backticks and quotes for the files (it breaks the console)

## New Features
- When developing a new feature, first write the implementation and then ask for feedback. Once the first version is aproved you can write the tests.
